In this project we utlize the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The actual raw data set came from this zip file.
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The contents of that zip file can be found in this repository under the data/RawData folder.
This script assumes the data is in the data/RawData folder.

In this repository you will find a R script that was developed to obtain the data and produce tidy data.
You will also find the CodeBook that will describe the steps taken to tidy the data as well as the description of this data.
